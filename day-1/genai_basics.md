GenAI Basics:

1. LLM (Large Language Model) is a neural network trained on large text data.
2. Tokens are small chunks of text processed by the model.
3. Context window defines how much text the model can remember.
4. Temperature controls randomness in responses.
5. Clear prompts give better outputs.
